// SIGTERM killed the process outright -- in-flight requests dropped mid-response, and Prisma's
// own connection pool was never told to close, leaving stale connections on the Postgres side
// until they timed out on their own. `server.close()` stops accepting new connections and lets
// in-flight ones finish; only once that's done (or the process is exiting regardless) is
// Prisma's pool disconnected, then the process exits cleanly. A second SIGTERM (an orchestrator
// escalating because the first one didn't exit fast enough) exits immediately rather than
// hanging a shutdown a second time.
