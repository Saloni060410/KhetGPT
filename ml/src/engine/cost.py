"""Cost estimate and comparison to the farmer's logged fertilizer history (S5).

Both figures are priced at today's fertilizer_products.csv rates, never a historical price
the farmer may actually have paid (we don't have that), so the comparison is apples to
apples: what this plan costs today, versus what already-applied fertilizer would cost today.

A product with no verified price (MOP, as of 2026-09-27 -- Richa re-checked: IFFCO's own
price list doesn't carry it, market listings were too inconsistent to cite) is never invented
a price, but no longer blocks the whole recommendation either (that was the pre-2026-09-27
behavior). It is simply excluded from cost.breakdown/estimated_cost_inr_per_acre -- its
quantity and schedule still come back from npk_calculator.to_products() as normal, and
recommendation_engine.py's data_notes says its cost is unavailable, once, per response.
A product with no ROW AT ALL in fertilizer_products.csv is a different, still-fatal problem
(estimate_cost still raises for that) -- an unknown product, not merely an unpriced one.
