"""S8: formula sanity gate.

For every ready crop and variety, and for low/medium/high soil combinations, an independent
recomputation of the dose formula -- Richa's evaluation.metrics.formula_conformity (contract
C7), which reads reference_doses.csv/soil_adjustments.csv/stcr_equations.csv directly -- must
match compute_balance()'s own fertilizer_needed_kg_ha within agronomy_rules.yaml's
formula_tolerance_pct. This never calls npk_calculator to recompute the formula a second time;
compute_balance() is only used once, to produce the actual recommendation this test then checks
against an independent source.

Only crops ready_crops() reports ready are tested (see test_not_ready_crops_are_listed for
which aren't, and why).
