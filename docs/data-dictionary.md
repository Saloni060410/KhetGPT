# Data dictionary

Units and meaning of the fields shared across services. Keep in step with `api-contract.md`, `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` and `ml/data/external/`.

## Soil (fixed by the problem statement)

Never add, remove or rename these fields.

| Field | Meaning | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| `n` | Available nitrogen | kg/ha. TODO(data): Richa confirms how each chosen dataset maps to this |
| `p` | Available phosphorus | kg/ha. TODO(data): confirm |
| `k` | Available potassium | kg/ha. TODO(data): confirm |
| `ph` | Soil pH | 0 to 14 |
| `organic_carbon` | Organic carbon content | percent |
| `moisture` | Soil moisture | percent |

## Crop

| Field | Meaning | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `crop_type` | Crop id | from `GET /reference/crops` (`ml/data/external/crops.csv`) |
| `variety` | Optional variety id | from the same endpoint, only where Richa's data has varieties |
| `growth_stage` | Stage id | from the same endpoint (`growth_stages.csv`) |
| `sowing_date` | Sowing date | `YYYY-MM-DD`, optional. Dates the schedule |

## Weather

| Field | Meaning | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| `temperature_c` | Current air temperature | degrees C |
| `humidity_pct` | Relative humidity | percent |
| `rainfall_mm_forecast` | Forecast rainfall for the next 5 days | mm |
| `source` | `live`, `cached` or `seasonal_average` | |

Current provider is **Open-Meteo** (no API key required) — see `ml/src/weather/`. An earlier
PRD draft specified OpenWeatherMap; that was superseded (see commit `9f25bf5`).

## Recommendation

| Field | Meaning | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| `quantity_kg_per_acre` | Fertilizer product quantity | kg/acre |
| `nutrient_balance.*.method` | `reference_dose` or `stcr` | |
| `nutrient_balance.*_kg_ha` | Standard dose, soil adjustment (signed), prior credit, fertilizer needed (P as P2O5, K as K2O) | kg/ha |
| `risk.level` | Over- and under-application risk | `low`, `medium`, `high` |
| `cost.*_inr_per_acre` | Plan cost, previous cost, saving | INR per acre |
| `model_version` | `<model>-<semver>+rules-<hash8>` | string |

## Training dataset unit reconciliation (R4)

The `fertilizer_prediction` training dataset (`ml/data/raw/fertilizer_prediction.csv`, see
`ml/data/README.md`) does **not** use the same units as the API/soil schema above, and the
mapping is only partial. Documented honestly rather than assumed:

| Dataset column | Renamed (clean.csv) | API/Soil Health Card equivalent | Mapping |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Nitrogen`, `Potassium`, `Phosphorous` | `nitrogen_raw`, `potassium_raw`, `phosphorous_raw` | `n`, `p`, `k` (kg/ha, elemental, Soil Health Card basis) | **No defensible mapping found.** The source doesn't state units, and values (0–42) are far too low to plausibly be kg/ha of available nutrient on any Soil Health Card convention. Left as unmapped, unitless "raw" columns — treated as relative/index values for the classifier only, never conflated with the API's `n`/`p`/`k`. |
| `Temparature`, `Humidity` | `temperature_c`, `humidity_pct` | `weather.temperature_c`, `weather.humidity_pct` | Plausible direct match (ranges and typical Punjab climate line up), but the source doesn't confirm units either — treated as a reasonable assumption, not a confirmed mapping. |
| `Moisture` | `moisture_pct` | `soil.moisture` (%) | Same caveat as temperature/humidity — plausible, not confirmed. |
| `Soil Type` (Sandy/Loamy/Black/Red/Clayey) | `soil_type` | *(none)* | **No equivalent field exists in the fixed soil schema** (`n, p, k, ph, organic_carbon, moisture`). This is a soil *texture* classification, not a chemistry measurement — kept as a classifier-only feature, not merged into any soil field. |
| *(none)* | *(none)* | `ph`, `organic_carbon` | The training dataset has **no pH or organic carbon column at all**. The classifier is trained without these two fixed-schema fields; whether/how to compensate for this at inference time is a feature-engineering decision for R6, not resolved here. |

**Net effect:** the fertilizer-*type* classifier trains on temperature, humidity, moisture,
soil type (texture), and unitless N/P/K index values — a real, documented limitation, not
hidden. It does not and cannot see pH or organic carbon. This is consistent with the R2
decision log's original framing: the classifier is a secondary product-choice refinement:
the *quantity* recommendation (which does need real kg/ha figures) comes entirely from
`reference_doses.csv`/`soil_adjustments.csv`, sourced independently from PAU, not from this
training dataset.

## External reference tables (`ml/data/external/`, contract C5)

Crop, region and fertilizer reference data live here, not in application code (NFR5). Richa
owns these files; Saloni's NPK calculator and Josh's reference proxy read them.

**Engine formula:** `fertilizer needed = standard dose + soil-test adjustment - credit from
recent applications`. `standard dose` comes from `reference_doses.csv`, `soil-test adjustment`
from `soil_adjustments.csv`, `credit` from `agronomy_rules.yaml`'s `credit_window_days` combined
with `nutrient_efficiency.csv`'s `fertilizer_use_efficiency`. `stcr_equations.csv` is an
optional, full alternative method for a nutrient (`nutrient_balance.*.method = "stcr"`) when a
per-field yield target is available and a sourced equation exists — not an addition on top of
the standard-dose-plus-adjustment path.

**Why not demand ÷ supply ÷ efficiency:** an earlier design computed
`(crop demand - soil supply) / use efficiency - credit`, fed by a `crop_requirements.csv` table
holding what was assumed to be the crop's gross nutrient uptake. It wasn't — the only sourced
numbers available (PAU's flat rates) are already **fertilizer-dose recommendations for
medium-fertility soil** ("add the following amounts of *fertilizers* ... on *medium fertile
soils*" — PAU POP Rabi 2025-26 p.9). Running an already-net dose through that formula
double-counted the soil's contribution and inflated the recommendation. This is also why a
`soil_supply_factor`/`fertilizer_use_efficiency` pair couldn't be sourced in the first place:
STCR's published coefficients (e.g. wheat `FN = 5.65T - 1.34SN`) pre-combine soil supply and
efficiency into single regression coefficients — there was never a separable pair to find. The
old `crop_requirements.csv` (itself a rename of R1's `crop_nutrient_norms.csv`) and its
`soil_rating_multipliers` block are retired under this design.

Cells marked `TODO(data)` mean a value could not be verified against an authoritative source
and was deliberately left blank rather than invented.

### crops.csv

| Column | Meaning | Unit / allowed values |
|---|---|---|
| `crop_id` | Stable snake_case identifier, used as `crop_type` across the API/DB/UI | e.g. `wheat`, `rice`, `maize`, `cotton`, `sugarcane`, `chickpea` |
| `name_en` | English display name | string |
| `name_hi` | Hindi display name | string (Devanagari) |
| `dataset_label` | The label this crop maps to in the chosen training dataset(s) | string |
| `season` | Cropping season | `rabi` / `kharif` / `annual` |
| `source` | Citation for this crop's inclusion/season | free text |

### crop_varieties.csv

Header-only unless a crop's chosen dataset actually distinguishes varieties. **Never lists the
`generic` fallback id** — that's a sentinel used only in `reference_doses.csv`, not a real
named variety.

| Column | Meaning | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| `crop_id` | Foreign key into crops.csv | snake_case id |
| `variety_id` | Stable snake_case identifier | e.g. `pr_132` |
| `name_en` / `name_hi` | Display names | string |
| `source` | Citation | free text |

One row as of this pass (`rice`/`pr_132`) — the only case in hand where PAU publishes a real,
different fertilizer dose by variety.

### growth_stages.csv

| Column | Meaning | Unit / allowed values |
|---|---|---|
| `crop_id` | Foreign key into crops.csv | snake_case id |
| `stage_id` | Stable snake_case identifier for the stage | e.g. `sowing`, `crown_root_initiation` |
| `name_en` / `name_hi` | Display names | string |
| `order` | 1-indexed sequence of the stage within the crop's lifecycle | integer |
| `das_start` / `das_end` | Days after sowing marking the start/end of the stage | integer days, or `TODO(data)` |
| `source` | Citation, including page number where available | free text |

**Rice is transplanted, not direct-sown.** Its `das_start`/`das_end` values for stages from
`first_n_split` onward are **Days After Transplanting (DAT)** per PAU convention, not days
after nursery sowing — the two diverge because nursery duration (25–45+ days) varies by
season and variety. This is flagged in each affected row's `source` cell. Anything consuming
these rice stage windows (e.g. `rain_hold` logic, split-schedule timing) must treat them as
DAT, not DAS, for rice specifically.

### reference_doses.csv

The **standard dose** — PAU's flat, medium-fertility-soil fertilizer recommendation, not gross
crop nutrient demand (see the engine-formula note above).

| Column | Meaning | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| `crop_id` | Foreign key into crops.csv | snake_case id |
| `variety_id` | Foreign key into crop_varieties.csv, or the fixed fallback `generic` | snake_case id |
| `irrigation` | Irrigation condition the dose applies to | `irrigated` / `rainfed` |
| `region` | State/region the dose applies to | e.g. `Punjab` |
| `n_kg_ha`, `p2o5_kg_ha`, `k2o_kg_ha` | Standard fertilizer dose | kg/ha (source tables are in kg/acre; converted at 1 acre = 0.4047 ha, i.e. x2.4711) |
| `source` | Citation, including page number | free text |
| `notes` | Caveats (soil-test-conditional additions, variety exceptions, alternative STCR equations, etc.) | free text |

Engine lookup order: exact `(crop_id, variety_id)` match, then `(crop_id, "generic")`.

**v0: wheat and rice** (real, PAU-sourced). Remaining crops land in a follow-up pass.

### soil_adjustments.csv

Adjusts the standard dose based on the field's own soil-test rating for that nutrient, using
PAU's published soil-test-conditional rules where they exist. Signed, in P2O5/K2O terms.

| Column | Meaning | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| `crop_id` | Foreign key into reference_doses.csv | snake_case id |
| `nutrient` | `n` / `p` / `k` | string |
| `soil_rating` | The soil_test_ratings.csv band this adjustment applies at | `very_low` / `low` / `medium` / `high`, or `TODO(data)` |
| `adjustment_kg_ha` | Amount to add to (positive) or subtract from (negative) the standard dose | kg/ha, or `TODO(data)` |
| `source` | Citation, or an explicit statement that no PAU adjustment table was found — never left blank | free text |
| `notes` | Caveats, including STCR alternatives where a full replacement equation exists instead | free text |

**A missing `(crop_id, nutrient, soil_rating)` row means no adjustment (0) — a deliberate, safe
default**, unlike the retired demand/supply formula's `soil_supply_factor`, where a missing
value couldn't safely default to anything (a 0 there would have overstated the deficit and
recommended *more* fertilizer, the wrong direction). Adjustments can be negative by design (e.g.
rice: PAU says apply P2O5/K2O "only when the soil test shows deficiency" — the standard dose
already assumes deficiency, so the adjustment for a *sufficient* soil test is `-` the full
standard dose, skipping it).

**Known gap:** wheat and rice N (and wheat P2O5) have no published PAU soil-test adjustment
table — only `TODO(data)` rows, with the STCR equation noted as a full alternative computation
path (see `stcr_equations.csv`).

### stcr_equations.csv

Optional. Soil Test Crop Response targeted-yield equations: `fertilizer needed = a * target
yield - b * soil test`, a full alternative to standard-dose-plus-adjustment for a given
crop/variety/nutrient when a yield target is available.

| Column | Meaning | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| `crop_id`, `variety_id` | The crop/variety this equation was calibrated for | snake_case id |
| `region` | Where the equation was calibrated — may differ from the demo region | free text |
| `applies_to` | Irrigation condition, inferred from the source table's "Situation" field | `irrigated` / `rainfed` |
| `nutrient` | `n` / `p` / `k` | string |
| `a`, `b` | Regression coefficients: `needed = a*T - b*ST` | numeric |
| `target_yield_default_q_ha` | A fallback yield target if the field doesn't supply one | q/ha, or `TODO(data)` |
| `source` | Citation | free text |
| `notes` | Caveats (region substitution, coefficient provenance, etc.) | free text |

**v0: wheat cv. WH 542, N and P2O5** (ICAR-IISS, Hisar/Haryana — the national STCR compilation
has no Punjab centre; Haryana is the nearest applicable substitute, same Trans-Gangetic Plain
zone, flagged via the `region` column rather than left implicit). `target_yield_default_q_ha`
is `TODO(data)` — no sourced typical/realistic Punjab wheat yield target found yet.
`applies_to` is an inference from the source document's "Situation: Irrigated" field, not a
literal source column — flagged in case a different `applies_to` semantics was intended.

### split_schedule.csv

| Column | Meaning | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| `crop_id`, `stage_id` | Foreign keys into crops.csv / growth_stages.csv | snake_case id |
| `n_fraction`, `p_fraction`, `k_fraction` | Share of that nutrient's total dose applied at this stage | 0–1, each nutrient's fractions sum to 1 across a crop's stages |

**v0: wheat and rice.** Note rice's stage timing is in Days After Transplanting (DAT), not
DAS — see the growth_stages.csv note above.

### nutrient_efficiency.csv

Used **only** to credit recent applications (`credit_kg_ha = prior_application_kg_ha *
fertilizer_use_efficiency`) — not for a demand/supply split, which is what caused the retired
formula's double-counting problem.

| Column | Meaning | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| `crop_id` | Crop this efficiency applies to, or the fixed fallback `default` | snake_case id |
| `nutrient` | `n` / `p` / `k` | string |
| `fertilizer_use_efficiency` | Share of applied nutrient the crop recovers | 0–1, or `TODO(data)` |
| `source` | Citation, or an explicit "no defensible source found" statement — never left blank | free text |
| `notes` | Caveats (national-average vs. region-specific, etc.) | free text |

Engine lookup order: exact `crop_id` match, then `default`. **v0: `default`/N only** (a real
but *national-average, rice-only* recovery-efficiency figure, 42.6%, used as an interim
stand-in and flagged as such) — P and K are `TODO(data)`.

### fertilizer_products.csv

| Column | Meaning | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| `product_id` | Stable snake_case identifier | e.g. `urea`, `dap`, `npk_10_26_26` |
| `name` | Display name | string |
| `dataset_label` | The label this product maps to in the chosen training dataset | string, e.g. `10-26-26` — replaces a separate alias file |
| `n_pct`, `p2o5_pct`, `k2o_pct` | Nutrient content by weight (guaranteed grade, per FCO 1985 nomenclature) | % (0–100) |
| `price_inr_per_kg` | Retail price | INR/kg, or `TODO(data)` if no defensible dated price was found |
| `price_date` | Date the price was current as of | ISO date, or `TODO(data)` if not confirmed |
| `bag_size_kg` | Retail bag size, for `GET /reference/fertilizers` | kg, or `TODO(data)`/null if unknown for that product |
| `source` | Citation (IFFCO price list, PIB/Department of Fertilizers notification, state MRP, etc.) | free text |

All 9 grades in the chosen training dataset have real N/P2O5/K2O percentages (FCO nomenclature
is definitional). Prices, dates and bag sizes are real and confirmed for urea (45kg), DAP,
NP 28-28-0 and NPK 10-26-26 (all 50kg) — IFFCO's published price list, w.e.f. 1 Jan 2025.
`bag_size_kg` is left `TODO(data)` rather than assumed for the remaining products even though
50kg is the common industry-standard bag size for most Indian fertilizer grades — no primary
citation was found for those specific products. MOP, SSP and the remaining NPK grades are
`price_inr_per_kg: TODO(data)` — they're under a **decontrolled MRP regime** (confirmed via PIB
Backgrounder, Release ID 2211384, 5 Jan 2026), so only their government *subsidy* rate is
publicly fixed, not the consumer price; subsidy figures are noted in each row for context but
never substituted for a retail price. **The engine must only select priced products** — a
missing price is never treated as 0.

### soil_test_ratings.csv

| Column | Meaning | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| `parameter` | Soil parameter name | `organic_carbon`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `ph` |
| `unit` | Unit that parameter is measured in | e.g. `%`, `kg/ha`, `pH units` |
| `very_low_below` | Optional cutoff for a 4th "very low" tier | same unit as `unit`, or blank/`TODO(data)` |
| `low_below` / `high_above` | Cutoffs separating low / medium / high ratings | same unit as `unit` |
| `source` | Citation | free text |

Full coverage (organic_carbon, n, p, k, ph) from ICAR-IISS Bhopal's national soil-test
interpretation ranges, as used on Soil Health Cards. `p`'s cutoffs are the Olsen-P method
figures, applicable to Punjab's predominantly alkaline soils. `k`'s `very_low_below` is
`TODO(data)` — PAU's wheat fertilizer table distinguishes a "very low" K tier (used by
`soil_adjustments.csv`'s `wheat/k/very_low` row) but doesn't itself publish the kg/ha cutoff
between "low" and "very low".

### seasonal_weather.csv

Fallback weather when a live/cached call isn't available (`weather.source = seasonal_average`).

| Column | Meaning | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| `region_key` | Region identifier | snake_case, e.g. `punjab_ludhiana` |
| `month` | Calendar month | 1–12 |
| `temperature_c`, `humidity_pct`, `rainfall_mm_5day` | Seasonal-average weather | °C, %, mm |
| `source` | Citation | free text |

One example row (`punjab_ludhiana`, January) — climate normals from a public aggregator, not
IMD directly; `rainfall_mm_5day` is a derived approximation (monthly total scaled to a 5-day
window), noted as such in the row's source cell. Remaining 11 months are a follow-up pass.

### agronomy_rules.yaml

Rule-layer parameters: nutrient credit window (days), rain-hold thresholds (mm / days), over-
and under-application risk ratios, and the sanity-test formula tolerance (%). Every key carries
an inline comment with either a source citation or the words "team assumption" — all keys
remain placeholders; validating them against real guidance is follow-up work.

### explanation_templates.yaml

`template_id -> {en, hi}` sentence with `{placeholders}`, keyed to Saloni's `rule_trace`
`rule_id`s (contract C6). Full coverage (every rule_id, risk reason, soil/yield impact
statement) is a follow-up pass — one example exists, matching `soil_adjustments.csv`'s
wheat-K-low rule, to prove the shape out.

## Reference tables (`ml/data/external/`, schemas in the prompt packs, contract C5)

`crops.csv`, `crop_varieties.csv`, `growth_stages.csv`, `reference_doses.csv`, `soil_adjustments.csv`, `stcr_equations.csv` (optional), `split_schedule.csv`, `nutrient_efficiency.csv` (per crop, used for credit only), `fertilizer_products.csv`, `soil_test_ratings.csv`, `agronomy_rules.yaml`, `explanation_templates.yaml`, `seasonal_weather.csv`. Every value has a `source`.
