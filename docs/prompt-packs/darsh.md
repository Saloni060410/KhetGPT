# Darsh — KhetGPT Prompt Pack

**Role:** Frontend: UI, 3D, animation  
**Branch:** `feature/darsh-frontend`  
**Repo:** https://github.com/Saloni060410/KhetGPT.git

Smart India Hackathon, PSAI01: Sustainable Fertilizer Usage Optimizer. This pack is generated from one shared plan, so the four packs always agree on steps, contracts and integration points.

## 1. Your role

You make everything the other three build visible and usable. This pack gives you the API calls and the basic needs. How it looks, feels and moves is yours.

You get the endpoints, the data shapes, the states that must be handled and a short list of non-negotiables. You choose the visual direction, layout, typography, motion and the concept for the 3D feature. Work against the mock first, then switch to the real backend as each endpoint lands.

**You own**

- `frontend/**` (React, R3F, GSAP, Tailwind, Zustand)
- `frontend/DEMO.md`
- `docs/backend-api.md` (review, with Josh)

**Hands off (owned by someone else)**

- `backend/** and docker-compose.yml` (Josh)
- `ml/**` (Saloni and Richa)

### Your call, and what is fixed

**You decide**

- The whole visual direction: style, palette, type, layout, spacing, iconography, illustration.
- Page structure, navigation pattern and how information is grouped and prioritised.
- Motion: what animates, where, and how much. GSAP is there for you to use, not a requirement on every screen.
- The concept for the 3D feature (PRD feature 12): what the scene shows and how people explore it.
- The landing page: message, structure and tone.
- Component and folder details inside src/, as long as all backend calls stay in src/services/.

**Non-negotiable**

- All backend calls go through src/services/api.js and endpoints.js. Components never call axios or fetch directly.
- Use design tokens (CSS variables mapped into Tailwind). No magic numbers in components.
- Text and interactive elements are legible and operable: readable contrast, visible keyboard focus, touch targets of at least 44 px, labels on icon-only buttons, respect prefers-reduced-motion.
- Every screen handles loading, empty, error and success. Every button has hover, active, focus, disabled and loading states.
- Works on a low-end Android phone on a slow connection (NFR2): no horizontal scroll from 320 px up, lazy-load anything heavy, keep the initial bundle small.
- The font you choose must include Devanagari glyphs for the Hindi toggle. Self-host fonts as woff2.
- Real content only: no invented statistics, testimonials or logos. Numbers on screen come from the API.
- Risk level is never conveyed by colour alone.
- No dead links, no console.log, no commented-out code in what you commit.

## 2. Initialize your system

**1. Check your machine**

```bash
node -v      # 22 or newer (CI uses 22)
npm -v
git --version
```

Expected: Node 22+.

**2. Clone and switch to your branch**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saloni060410/KhetGPT.git
cd KhetGPT
git checkout feature/darsh-frontend
git pull origin main --rebase
```

Expected: Branch feature/darsh-frontend, rebased on the latest main.

**3. Install and configure**

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
npm install
```

Expected: .env has VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/api. You will add VITE_USE_MOCK in D2.

**4. Run and verify**

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
```

Expected: Lint and build clean. Every route renders its stub: /, /login, /register, /dashboard, /fields/1/soil, /fields/1/recommendation, /fields/1/history.

**5. Optional: run the real backend**

```bash
# in another terminal, from the repo root, once Josh's J3 and J4 are merged:
docker compose up -d postgres
cd backend && npm install && npm run db:reset && npm run dev
# ML mock (Saloni's S2):
cd ml && source .venv/bin/activate && PREDICT_MODE=mock uvicorn src.api.main:app --port 8001
```

Expected: You only need this for the integration steps. Before that, VITE_USE_MOCK=true is enough.

**6. Open Claude Code**

```bash
cd ..            # repo root
claude
```

Expected: Run every prompt below from the repo root.

## 5. Who you depend on, and who depends on you

Hard need = you cannot finish the step without it. Integrates with = you can start on a mock or fixture, but the step is only complete once the other person's work is merged and you have tested against it. Pairs with = you finish it together.

| Step | Blocked by (hard) | Pairs with | Integrates with | Unblocks | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **D0** Verify your frontend environment | none | none | none | none |  |

## 6. Team timeline and integration gates

- **Phase 0: Kickoff and contracts.** Everyone sets up, and the shared contracts are agreed and merged before anyone builds against them.
- **Phase 1: Foundations in parallel.** Each person builds their base layer against contracts and fixtures. Nobody waits for anybody.
- **Phase 2: Real data and real CRUD.** Real datasets and tables land, the model trains, the API stores real farm data, forms save it.
- **Phase 3: Real recommendation.** Mock mode is switched off. Data, model, backend and UI produce one real recommendation.
- **Phase 4: Packaging and standout.** One-command stack, CI green, the 3D feature, Hindi toggle, evaluation evidence.
- **Phase 5: Demo hardening.** Rehearse, freeze, write the model card, prepare fallbacks.

### G0 — Contracts locked (end of Phase 0)

C1 (ML API), C3 (backend REST API), the fixtures and the crop vocabulary are merged to main. Nobody changes them without the change process.

**Who delivers what**

- Saloni + Josh: review and lock docs/api-contract.md and docs/contract-fixtures/ (S1, J1)
- Josh + Darsh: docs/backend-api.md merged (J1)
- Richa: crops, varieties, stages and header-only reference tables merged (R1)
- Everyone: dev environment running on their own branch (S0, R0, J0, D0)

**Acceptance test:** Every teammate can read the fixtures and say what each endpoint returns. Josh, Saloni and Darsh have approved the contract PRs.

**If it slips:** Do not start Phase 1 code that depends on an unmerged contract. Build only environment and non-contract work until it merges.

### G1 — Mock vertical slice (end of Phase 1)

One request travels the whole chain with fake numbers: frontend, backend, database and the ML service in mock mode.

**Your steps at this gate:** D3 (Sign up, log in, log out), D4 (First recommendation screen)

**Who delivers what**

- Saloni: ML mock mode plus reference endpoints on main (S2)
- Josh: seeded database, real auth and the thin recommendation route (J2, J3, J4)
- Darsh: shell, auth pages and a first recommendation screen (D2, D3, D4)
- Richa: datasets chosen, reference tables v0, cleaning pipeline (R2, R3, R4)

**Acceptance test:** Log in as the seeded farmer, open the seeded field, press Get recommendation, see a mocked plan on screen, and find the stored row in Postgres.

**If it slips:** Darsh runs with VITE_USE_MOCK=true. Josh stubs the ML call with the fixture. Neither blocks on the other.

### G2 — Data to engine handoff (end of Phase 2)

Richa's tables and feature module feed Saloni's deficit engine and trainer, and the app stores real farm data.

**Your steps at this gate:** D5 (Farms and fields, and setting a location), D6 (Soil input, crop and variety selection, fertilizer log)

**Who delivers what**

- Richa: feature module, dataset build, frozen test split, weather client and seasonal fallback on main (R6, R7)
- Saloni: first trained model v0.1.0 (S3) and a passing NPK-deficit calculator on Richa's tables (S4)
- Josh: CRUD, reference proxy, weather and geocoding on main (J5, J6, J7)
- Darsh: farm, field, soil, crop and fertilizer log screens saving real data (D5, D6)

**Acceptance test:** python -m src.models.train runs from a clean checkout and prints a comparison table. The engine's golden tests pass on the reference tables. Darsh creates a farm, field and soil test in the UI and Josh's database holds them.

**If it slips:** Saloni trains on sample_train.csv. Engine tests use the v0 tables. The UI keeps using the mock for anything unmerged.

### G3 — Real end to end (end of Phase 3)

Mock mode is off. A real engine, real weather and real stored data produce the recommendation the user sees, with the risk warning and the formula inputs.

**Your steps at this gate:** D7 (The full recommendation screen), D8 (Schedule page with print and PDF export), D9 (Field profile, history and nutrient trends)

**Who delivers what**

- Saloni: cost, recommendation engine in real mode, contract tests (S5, S6, S7)
- Richa: risk analyzer, metrics, explanations, demo scenarios (R8, R9, R10, R11)
- Josh: full recommendation orchestration and history, risk check and trends (J8, J9)
- Darsh: full recommendation screen, schedule page, history and trends (D7, D8, D9)

**Acceptance test:** Signup, farm, field, soil test, crop and stage, Get recommendation. The result shows a real model_version, a dated schedule, the risk with its soil and yield impact, cost and the deficit numbers. History and the schedule page show it afterwards.

**If it slips:** Ship G3 with mock mode and label it in the UI as sample output. Do not hide that it is a mock.

### G4 — One-command stack (end of Phase 4)

docker compose up brings up Postgres, ML and backend healthy from a clean clone. CI is green. The standout UI features work on the real stack.

**Your steps at this gate:** D10 (Check my own dose), D11 (The standout visualization), D12 (English and Hindi toggle), D13 (Landing page and brand finish)

**Who delivers what**

- Josh: compose and CI (J10), hardening (J11)
- Saloni: ML image, artifact strategy, formula sanity gate, final test evaluation (S8, S9)
- Richa: evaluation report with impact estimate (R12)
- Darsh: what-if dose check, 3D visualization, language toggle, landing (D10, D11, D12, D13)

**Acceptance test:** A teammate who has never run the project clones it, follows the README and reaches a working recommendation in under 15 minutes.

**If it slips:** Frontend runs from npm run dev against the compose stack. Ship the standout feature only if it meets the performance contract.

### G5 — Demo freeze (end of Phase 5)

Rehearsed on two machines. Fallbacks work. Model card and evaluation report are written. main is tagged.

**Your steps at this gate:** D14 (Launch checks, offline fallback and demo path)

**Who delivers what**

- Saloni: model card and demo readiness (S10, S11)
- Josh: demo seed and reset (J12)
- Darsh: launch pass and offline fallback build (D14)
- Richa: reproducible data commands and docs (R13)

**Acceptance test:** Full demo run on two laptops, once with internet and once with mock fallbacks. The three demo scenarios behave as documented in docs/demo-scenarios.md.

**If it slips:** Cut features, never the rehearsal. Anything unfinished is removed from the demo path, not left half-working.

## 7. Contracts you share with the team

| # | Contract | Where | Owners | Locks at |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | ML API: POST /recommend, POST /risk-score and GET /health between the backend and the ML service. Code sides: ml/src/api/schemas.py and backend/src/services/mlService.js. A pre-filled v1.0 draft is already in the repo. S1 and J1 review and lock it. | `docs/api-contract.md, docs/contract-fixtures/` | Saloni, Josh | G0 |
| C2 | Reference data API: Crops, varieties, growth stages, soil rating cut-offs, fertilizer products and the seasonal-weather fallback. Richa authors the files, Saloni serves them, Josh proxies them, Darsh reads them. Nothing is hardcoded in the UI or the backend. | `ml/data/external/*, ML /reference/*, backend /api/reference/*` | Richa, Saloni, Josh, Darsh | G0 (shape), G2 (real data) |
| C3 | Backend REST API: Every endpoint the frontend calls: auth, farms, fields, soil tests, fertilizer logs, weather, geocoding, recommendations, risk check, trends, reference. | `docs/backend-api.md` | Josh, Darsh | G0 |
| C4 | Feature module and loaders: The single feature code path used by training and serving, and the loader that reads the reference tables once. | `ml/src/data_pipeline/feature_engineering.py, soil_data_loader.py` | Richa, Saloni | G2 |
| C5 | Reference table schemas: Crop requirements, use efficiencies, split schedules, fertilizer products and prices, soil rating cut-offs, agronomy rules, seasonal weather. Column schemas are agreed in R1, values arrive in R3. | `ml/data/external/` | Richa, Saloni | G0 (schemas), G1 (v0 values) |
| C6 | Rule trace, risk and explanations: Saloni's engine emits a nutrient balance and a rule trace. Richa's risk analyzer and explain() turn them into a risk level, soil and yield impact text and reasons. | `ml/src/degradation/risk_analyzer.py, ml/src/evaluation/explainability.py` | Saloni, Richa | G2 |
| C7 | Evaluation and run records: Richa's metric functions, Saloni's run record format. Both feed the model card. | `ml/src/evaluation/metrics.py, models_artifacts/runs/` | Richa, Saloni | G3 |

**C1 decisions (pre-filled in docs/api-contract.md)**

1. Soil schema is fixed by the problem statement: n, p, k, ph, organic_carbon, moisture. It is not extended.
2. Request adds optional variety (only if Richa's data has varieties) and optional sowing_date. The backend stores them as Field.cropVariety and Field.sowingDate. They are already in the Prisma schema.
3. Endpoints: POST /recommend, POST /risk-score (score a planned dose), GET /health, GET /reference/*.
4. Core method: fertilizer needed = (crop demand - soil supply) / use efficiency - credit from recent applications. The response returns these inputs per nutrient in explanation.nutrient_balance.
5. Each schedule[] item carries fertilizer_type. Top-level fertilizer_type is the primary product and its quantity_kg_per_acre is that product's total across the schedule.
6. risk has level, reason, soil_health_impact and yield_impact. The impact texts state the consequence in plain language, as the problem statement asks.
7. weather.source is live, cached or seasonal_average. The backend sends it, the ML service echoes what it used.
8. cost and impact fields are null when the farmer logged no previous usage. Never invent a baseline.
9. Units: kg/acre in the API, soil N, P, K in kg/ha, organic_carbon and moisture in percent. Internal conversion 1 ha = 2.4711 acre.
10. Errors: 422 { detail: [...] } for invalid input, 503 { detail } when the model or reference data is unavailable.
11. model_version format: <model>-<semver>+rules-<hash8>.

run record (Saloni): { run_id, name, tags, git_sha, config_hash, dataset_hash, env, params, metrics, wall_clock_s }
```

**How to change a contract**

1. Propose the change in a docs-only PR to main titled docs: <contract> <change>.
2. Both owners of the contract approve it in the PR.
3. Merge to main, then both owners run git pull origin main --rebase on their branches the same day.
4. Update code, schemas and fixtures immediately. The contract tests fail if code and docs drift.

## 8. Step-by-step prompts

Run each prompt in Claude Code from the repo root, on your own branch, in order. Check the Done when line before you move on.

### Phase 0: Kickoff and contracts

#### D0. Verify your frontend environment

**Done when:** Lint and build pass and every stub route renders in the browser.

````text
Read AGENTS.md (root) and frontend/AGENTS.md. I am Darsh, owner of frontend/** on branch feature/darsh-frontend. Work only inside frontend/.
1. Confirm the branch and that it is rebased on origin/main.
2. In frontend/: cp .env.example .env, npm install, npm run lint, npm run build, then npm run dev (Vite on 5173). Open every route in the browser and confirm it renders its stub.
3. Note the Node version (CI uses 22).
Report any error. Fix only environment problems.
````

### Phase 1: Foundations in parallel

#### D1. Choose your direction and build your foundation

Unblocks D2, D13

**Done when:** frontend/DESIGN.md explains your direction in a few lines, the tokens exist, and a temporary /kit route shows your components at 390 px and 1280 px.

> Everything else in the frontend builds on this. The look is entirely your decision.

````text
Read frontend/AGENTS.md. I am choosing the visual direction myself. Do not impose one. Start by asking me what I have in mind, or offer three short contrasting directions with a one-paragraph rationale each (fit for farmers on low-end phones, a memorable identity, room for a standout 3D moment) and let me pick.

Once I have chosen:
1. Write frontend/DESIGN.md: the direction in a few lines, the palette, the type pairing, the spacing scale and the motion principles.
2. Produce the token set first: src/styles/tokens.css with --color-*, --font-*, --space-*, --radius-*, --shadow-*, --ease-* and --dur-*, mapped into tailwind.config.js. Components use tokens only.
3. Fonts: self-host woff2 (Fontsource), subset, font-display: swap, and make sure the family (or a paired fallback) has Devanagari glyphs, because the Hindi toggle comes later.
4. Build the components I will need in src/components/ui/: Button, Input, Select, Textarea, FormField (label, hint, error), Card, Badge, a risk badge for low, medium and high (colour, icon and text together), Skeleton, Toast, Modal, EmptyState. Every interactive component has hover, active, focus-visible, disabled and loading states, and touch targets of at least 44 px.
5. Add a temporary /kit route that shows all components; I remove it in D14.
Show me screenshots of /kit at 390 px and 1280 px.

#### D2. API layer, mock mode, shell and routing

Needs D1, J1 · Unblocks D3, D4, D5

**Done when:** With VITE_USE_MOCK=true every route navigates, the mobile menu works by keyboard, and there is no horizontal scroll at 320 px.

> You need docs/backend-api.md merged (Josh's J1) so the mock and the real API have the same shape.

````text
Read docs/backend-api.md (contract C3) and frontend/AGENTS.md. Build the plumbing. Layout and look are my decision (use my tokens and components from D1).

1. src/services/api.js stays the only place that talks to the backend: attach the bearer token, on a 401 call POST /auth/refresh once and retry the original request, otherwise log out; normalise errors to { status, message, details }.
2. src/services/endpoints.js with one function per endpoint in contract C3: auth, farms, fields, soil tests, fertilizer logs, weather, recommendations and reference.
3. src/services/mock/: an in-memory mock implementing the same functions with realistic data from docs/contract-fixtures/, switched on by VITE_USE_MOCK=true. Add VITE_USE_MOCK to .env.example. I must never be blocked on the backend.
4. Zustand: useUserStore (user, tokens, login, logout, hydrate from localStorage inside try and catch), useFarmStore, useRecommendationStore.
5. Routing in App.jsx: public routes (landing, login, register) and protected routes through a RequireAuth wrapper; a 404 page; an error boundary around each route.
6. A navigation shell of my design. If it collapses on mobile it needs a real off-canvas menu: focus trap, Escape closes, scroll lock, aria-expanded on the toggle, closes on route change. Include a skip-to-content link.
7. Dynamic document titles in the form "Page — KhetGPT".
Verify with VITE_USE_MOCK=true and show me the results.
````

#### D3. Sign up, log in, log out

**Integration gate G1** · Needs D2 · Integrates with J3

**Done when:** Auth works against the mock and against Josh's real endpoints, including refresh after the access token expires.

````text
Build the login and register screens (pages/Auth/). The design is mine. The API calls and rules:
- POST /auth/register { email, password, name, role: "FARMER" | "AGRONOMIST" } gives 201 { user, accessToken, refreshToken }; 409 means the email is taken.
- POST /auth/login { email, password } gives 200 { user, accessToken, refreshToken }; 401 means "Invalid email or password".
- POST /auth/logout { refreshToken }; GET /auth/me.
Must handle: inline validation, submit disabled while pending, input preserved on error, clear messages from the API, a role choice on register, redirect back to the page the user came from, and logout available from the shell.
Develop against the mock (VITE_USE_MOCK=true), then switch to Josh's real auth (J3) with VITE_USE_MOCK=false and test register, login, refresh after the access token expires (set JWT_ACCESS_TTL=30s locally to prove it) and logout. Show me screenshots of both modes.
````

#### D4. First recommendation screen

**Integration gate G1** · Needs D2 · Integrates with J4, S2 · Unblocks D7, J4

**Done when:** For the seeded field, one button press shows a plan on screen, working against the mock and against Josh's J4 route with Saloni's ML mock.

> This is the frontend half of Gate G1. It proves the whole chain works before any real model exists.

````text
Build the first version of the recommendation screen. Layout and visual treatment are mine. The call:
POST /fields/:id/recommendations (body optional) gives 201 with:
Recommendation { id, fieldId, soilTestId, cropType, growthStage, fertilizerType, quantityKgPerAcre, schedule: [{ stage, fertilizerType, quantityKgPerAcre, applyBy }], risk: { level: "low"|"medium"|"high", reason }, topFactors: [string], cost: { estimatedCostPerAcre, previousCostPerAcre|null, savingPerAcre|null, savingTotal|null }, impact: { overApplicationReductionPct|null }, weatherStale, modelVersion, createdAt }
Errors: 409 means a soil test or crop is missing (the message says which), 502 means the recommendation service is unavailable.
Must show at minimum: the product and quantity in kg/acre, the schedule (what, how much, when), the risk level with its reason, the top factors, and cost and saving when present. The model version can be small.
Must handle: a skeleton while loading (no spinner for under 300 ms), error with a Retry, and the 409 case with a link to fix it.
For Gate G1 a temporary way to trigger it for the seeded field is fine. Show me the screen at 390 px with data from the whole chain.
````

### Phase 2: Real data and real CRUD

#### D5. Farms and fields, and setting a location

**Integration gate G2** · Needs D2 · Integrates with J5, J7 · Unblocks D6, J5

**Done when:** You can create, list and open farms and fields against the real backend, set a field's location three ways, with optimistic updates that roll back on failure.

````text
Build farm and field management. Design is mine. The calls:
GET /farms (paginated), POST /farms { name }, GET /farms/:id, DELETE /farms/:id
GET /farms/:farmId/fields, POST /farms/:farmId/fields { name, areaAcres?, latitude?, longitude?, pincode? }
GET /fields/:id (includes latest soil test and latest recommendation), PATCH /fields/:id
GET /geocode?q=place name -> [{ name, admin, latitude, longitude }] (empty list when nothing matches)
Must have: a place to see farms with their fields; create farm; create field; a way to see a field's crop, stage, sowing date, latest soil test and latest recommendation with links onward.
Location: coordinates are what the weather needs, so a field must end up with latitude and longitude. Offer all three ways: "use my current location" (handle a denied permission gracefully), search by place name through GET /geocode with the results as a pick list, and typing latitude and longitude. The pincode is an optional label only, and is never turned into coordinates. Show the chosen place and coordinates back to the user before saving, so a farmer can catch a wrong village.
Optimistic UI for create and delete with a rollback and message on failure. Skeletons for lists and an empty state that shows the next action. A map picker is a stretch, do not add a map library now. Build against the mock, then Josh's J5 and J7.
````

#### D6. Soil input, crop and variety selection, fertilizer log

**Integration gate G2** · Needs D5 · Integrates with J5, J6, R1 · Unblocks D12, J5

**Done when:** A user can save a soil test, choose crop, variety (when the crop has any), stage and sowing date, log past fertilizer, and reach Get recommendation. No crop, variety, stage or fertilizer list lives in the frontend code.

> The soil form has exactly six fields and that is fixed by the problem statement. Check units and labels against Richa's docs/data-dictionary.md. Crop, variety and stage ids come from the reference API.

````text
Build the data entry flow (PRD FR3 to FR5). Design is mine. The calls:
POST /fields/:id/soil-tests { n, p, k, ph, organicCarbon, moisture, testedOn? } (n, p, k in kg/ha, organicCarbon and moisture in percent). These six fields are fixed by the problem statement. Do not add or rename any.
PATCH /fields/:id { cropType, cropVariety?, growthStage, sowingDate }
POST and GET /fields/:id/fertilizer-logs { type, quantityKgPerAcre, appliedOn }
GET /reference/crops gives [{ id, nameEn, nameHi, varieties: [{ id, nameEn, nameHi }], stages: [{ id, nameEn, nameHi, order }] }]
GET /reference/soil-ratings gives low and high cut-offs per parameter
GET /reference/fertilizers gives products with names and ids
Must have: the six soil fields with plain-language help, units and valid ranges, plus a rating (low, medium, high) computed from /reference/soil-ratings, never from numbers in the UI; a crop and stage chooser filled from /reference/crops; a variety chooser that appears only when the selected crop has varieties (hide it otherwise, and allow leaving it empty); a sowing date; a fertilizer log with product from /reference/fertilizers, quantity in kg/acre and a date that cannot be in the future, plus the list of past applications; a clear path to "Get recommendation". Until Richa's tables are merged the mock serves the reference lists, so leave no crop list in the code.
Must handle: inline validation, no double submit, input preserved on error. Test against the mock, then Josh's J5 and J6.
````

### Phase 3: Real recommendation

#### D7. The full recommendation screen

**Integration gate G3** · Needs D4 · Integrates with J8, S6, R11 · Unblocks D8, D9, D10, D11, J8

**Done when:** The three demo scenarios each render correctly against the real chain, with every case and state handled.

> This is the frontend half of Gate G3. The screen every judge will look at.

````text
Upgrade the recommendation screen for the real engine. How it is laid out and presented is my decision. What it must communicate to a non-technical farmer, using the Recommendation object from D4 (now including risk.soilHealthImpact, risk.yieldImpact, nutrientBalance, formula, weatherSource):
- what to apply, how much and when, with split doses visible, and any rain delay mentioned by the reasons,
- the risk level, its reason, and the two impact sentences (what it does to soil health and to yield), understandable without colour,
- the working: for each of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, the crop demand, what the soil supplies, the deficit and the fertilizer needed (nutrientBalance and formula), so the number is never a black box,
- cost per acre, the previous cost, the saving per acre and the field total when area exists. When saving is null show a prompt to log previous fertilizer use instead of a number. When saving is negative explain that this plan costs more than recent use and why, using the top factors,
- the 2 to 3 reasons (topFactors) as readable sentences,
- the weather that was used, from GET /fields/:id/weather { temperatureC, humidityPct, rainfallMmForecast, source, fetchedAt, stale }, with a clear note when the source is cached or a seasonal average,
- the over-application reduction only when impact returns it,
- a link to the schedule page (D8).
Handle every error and empty case. Run against the real chain (Saloni S6 and Josh J8) and show me the screen for the three scenarios in docs/demo-scenarios.md.
````

#### D8. Schedule page with print and PDF export

**Integration gate G3** · Needs D7 · Integrates with J8, S6 · Unblocks D14

**Done when:** A recommendation opens as a schedule that reads in under 30 seconds, prints cleanly on A4 and on a phone, and saves as PDF from the browser's print dialog.

> PRD FR11. No PDF library is needed. A print stylesheet and the browser's Save as PDF are enough and keep the bundle small.

````text
Build the schedule page (route /fields/:fieldId/schedule). Design is mine. It shows one recommendation's schedule (schedule: [{ stage, fertilizerType, quantityKgPerAcre, applyBy }]) from GET /recommendations/:id or the latest for the field. A smallholder farmer must be able to read what to apply, how much and when in under 30 seconds, and hand the page to an input dealer.
Must have: dates in a calendar or timeline form, quantities in kg/acre and as bags where it helps, the field and crop in a header, a short risk note, and a Print / Save as PDF button that calls the browser's print. Add a print stylesheet: no navigation, no animations, high contrast, page breaks that never split a stage, black and white friendly (never colour alone), one page for a typical plan. It must look right at 390 px and on A4. Fallback for offline: render from the last cached recommendation.
Show me the screen at 390 px and 1280 px, and the print preview as PDF.
````

#### D9. Field profile, history and nutrient trends

**Integration gate G3** · Needs D7 · Integrates with J8, J9 · Unblocks J8, J9

**Done when:** The field profile pages through history, opens a past recommendation, and draws the trend series with a text alternative.

````text
Build the field profile (route /fields/:fieldId) and history (route /fields/:fieldId/history). Design is mine. The calls:
GET /fields/:id/recommendations?page&limit gives { items, page, limit, total } newest first; GET /recommendations/:id gives one Recommendation.
GET /fields/:id/trends gives { soilTests: [{ testedOn, n, p, k, ph, organicCarbon, moisture }], applied: [{ month, nitrogenKgAcre, p2o5KgAcre, k2oKgAcre, costInr }], recommendations: [{ createdAt, fertilizerType, quantityKgPerAcre, estimatedCost, riskLevel, fertilizerNeededN, fertilizerNeededP, fertilizerNeededK }] }.
Must have: the field's crop, stage, location and latest soil rating; the history list (when, crop and stage, product, quantity, risk, saving) with pagination and opening a past item; charts for nutrient levels over time, fertilizer applied per month against what was recommended, and cost. NFR2 says lightweight, so the chart approach is my call (a hand-written SVG or a chart library, lazy-loaded so it stays out of the initial bundle). Whatever the charts look like they need labelled axes, an emphasised latest point and an accessible table alternative. Skeleton, empty and error states, and a friendly empty state for a field with no history yet. Test with many rows from the mock.
````

### Phase 4: Packaging and standout

#### D10. Check my own dose

**Integration gate G4** · Needs D7 · Integrates with J9, R8 · Unblocks J9

**Done when:** Entering 2x the recommended urea shows a high risk with both impact sentences before anything is saved.

> This delivers the problem statement's warning about the impact of excessive fertilizer use, at the moment the farmer is deciding.

````text
Build a "check my own plan" interaction (PRD FR12), wherever it fits best in my design. The call:
POST /fields/:id/risk-check { plannedApplication: [{ fertilizerType, quantityKgPerAcre }] } gives { risk: { level, reason, soilHealthImpact, yieldImpact, overApplicationPct }, nutrientBalance: { n|p|k: { appliedKgHa, recommendedKgHa, ratio } } }.
Must have: a way to enter one or more products (from GET /reference/fertilizers) and quantities in kg/acre; the result showing the risk level, the reason and the two impact sentences; applied versus recommended per nutrient so the farmer sees which nutrient is too high or too low; a route from the result back to the recommended plan. Do not save anything. Debounce if the check runs as the user types. Handle the 409 case (no soil test or crop yet) with a link to fix it. Risk is never shown by colour alone.
````

#### D11. The standout visualization

**Integration gate G4** · Needs D7 · Integrates with J6 · Unblocks D14

**Done when:** The scene runs smoothly on a throttled CPU, degrades to a text and CSS version, and the initial bundle did not grow.

> PRD feature 14 asks for an explorable 3D or animated view of nutrient balance using React Three Fiber and GSAP. The concept is yours.

````text
Load the threejs-r3f-mastery skill if you have it. Before writing code, propose two or three concepts for an explorable visualization of a field's nutrient balance and let me choose. The concept, look and interaction are mine.

Data you have: the soil test values (n, p, k in kg/ha, ph, organicCarbon and moisture in percent), the low and high cut-offs from GET /reference/soil-ratings, and from the recommendation the working per nutrient: nutrientBalance { n|p|k: { cropDemandKgHa, soilSupplyKgHa, deficitKgHa, useEfficiency, priorCreditKgHa, fertilizerNeededKgHa } } plus the risk. Demand versus supply versus deficit is the story the scene can tell. It should animate when the soil test or recommendation changes (GSAP with useGSAP so timelines are cleaned up by the hook).

Fixed by the project:
- Lazy-load the scene (React.lazy with Suspense and a real skeleton). The initial JS bundle must not grow.
- Canvas: dpr={[1, 1.5]} and frameloop="demand" (render on change), no realtime shadows, simple or instanced geometry, dispose imperative geometries and materials, pause when the tab is hidden.
- Fallback: when WebGL is unavailable, on webglcontextlost, when prefers-reduced-motion is set, or on very low-end devices (navigator.hardwareConcurrency of 2 or less, or deviceMemory of 2 or less), show a lightweight 2D version with the same numbers.
- Accessibility: the same values are available as text under the scene, and the scene can be operated without a mouse.
Show me the bundle report before and after and a performance profile on a throttled CPU.
````

#### D12. English and Hindi toggle

**Integration gate G4** · Needs D6 · Integrates with R1 · Unblocks D14

**Done when:** Every screen works in both languages with no clipped text at 320 px, and the choice is remembered.

````text
Add the English and Hindi toggle (PRD feature 11) without a heavy library: src/i18n/en.js and hi.js, a useT() hook backed by a Zustand language store persisted in localStorage (in try and catch), the lang attribute on <html> kept in sync, and the Devanagari font loaded only when Hindi is selected. Translate all UI text: labels, errors, empty states, risk labels. Crop, variety, stage and fertilizer names come from the reference API (nameHi from Richa's tables). The explanation sentences returned by the ML service stay English in v1: show a small note when Hindi is on and leave a TODO(i18n) for a later template-id based approach. Check the layout with long Hindi strings at 320 px and check that numbers and dates format correctly.
````

#### D13. Landing page and brand finish

**Integration gate G4** · Needs D1 · Unblocks D14

**Done when:** The landing page, favicon set, share tags and error pages exist and match your direction.

````text
Build the landing page and the finishing pieces. The message, structure, tone, imagery and motion are mine. Fixed: real copy only (no invented statistics, testimonials or logos), everything visible without scrolling or waiting for an animation, motion respects prefers-reduced-motion, and it is fast on a phone. Add: a favicon set (favicon.ico, icon.svg, a 180 px apple-touch icon and a manifest), Open Graph and Twitter tags with a 1200 by 630 image under 1 MB and an absolute URL, robots.txt and sitemap.xml, and custom 404 and 500 pages in the same style. If time remains, PRD features 14 (field map picker), 15 (voice input) or 16 (assistant) are open for you to propose. Raise it with the team first because 14 and 16 need backend work.
````

### Phase 5: Demo hardening

#### D14. Launch checks, offline fallback and demo path

**Integration gate G5** · Needs D8, D11, D12, D13 · Integrates with R11

**Done when:** Every check passes, a mock build runs with no backend, and frontend/DEMO.md describes the demo path with screenshots.

````text
Load the launch-readiness-polisher skill if you have it. Pre-launch pass. Run and fix:
- zero horizontal scroll at 320, 360, 390, 768, 1024, 1280 and 1440 px (document.documentElement.scrollWidth === clientWidth); content still reflows at 200 percent zoom,
- touch targets of at least 44 px and a keyboard-only run through signup to recommendation, schedule and the dose check,
- the schedule page prints on A4 and saves as PDF correctly,
- Lighthouse on a throttled mobile profile (targets: Performance 90 or more, Accessibility 95 or more, Best Practices 100, SEO 100),
- report the initial JS size (gzip) and confirm the 3D and chart chunks are lazy,
- clean console, remove the /kit route, console.log calls and commented-out code.
Offline-friendly mode (PRD feature 15): cache the last recommendation, its schedule and the reference lists (localStorage or IndexedDB, in try and catch) and show them with an offline notice.
Fallback build: VITE_USE_MOCK=true npm run build must produce a bundle that runs with no backend, using the fixtures, so the demo survives a network failure.
Write frontend/DEMO.md with the 2 minute demo path and a screenshot of each screen.
````

## 9. Definition of done

- [ ] All backend calls go through src/services/. No crop, variety, stage, fertilizer or rating list in the code.
- [ ] The soil form has exactly the six fixed fields.
- [ ] Every screen has loading, empty, error and success states.
- [ ] The schedule prints and saves as PDF. The dose check warns before anything is saved.
- [ ] No horizontal scroll from 320 px. Keyboard-only run works. Reduced motion respected.
- [ ] Initial bundle stays small and the 3D and chart chunks are lazy.
- [ ] Risk is readable without colour. Hindi fits without clipping.
- [ ] The mock build runs with no backend.
- [ ] Lint and build pass in CI. No console.log or commented-out code committed.

## 10. Daily sync questions

- Josh: which endpoint or field are you waiting on? Did any response shape surprise you?
- Saloni: are the risk reasons and factors readable on screen? Any new field in the recommendation?
- Richa: are crop and stage names, units and Hindi names final?

## 11. Ground rules for everyone

- The soil schema is fixed by the problem statement: n, p, k, ph, organic_carbon, moisture. Never add, remove or rename soil fields.
- Work on your own branch. Never commit to main directly, except docs-only contract PRs that both owners have approved.
- Stay inside your folders (root AGENTS.md). If you need a change in someone else's folder, ask them or record it in the contract doc.
- Commit messages use the form <area>: <what changed>, for example ml: add NPK deficit calculator. No AI co-author trailers and no "Generated with" lines in commits or PR descriptions.
- Never commit .env, raw datasets, models_artifacts/, node_modules or .venv. Add new variables to that service's .env.example.
- Before a PR: git pull origin main --rebase, lint and tests pass, and the PR description states the change, the reason and how to test it. UI PRs include screenshots. One teammate reviews before merge.
- Open a PR only when a feature works end to end. Small, focused commits, one logical change each.
- Run every prompt in Claude Code from the repo root on your own branch. Each prompt begins by reading the project context files.
- Reference numbers (crop demand, efficiencies, prices, thresholds) live in data or config files, never in application code, and every value has a source.
- No cloud deployment is in scope. The demo runs locally with docker-compose.
