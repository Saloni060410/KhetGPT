# API Contract: Frontend to Backend (v1.0)

Owned jointly by **Josh** (backend) and **Darsh** (frontend). Contract C3 in the team's shared
vocabulary. Written from the actual implemented routes/controllers/Prisma schema, verified
directly — real curl transcripts against the full `docker compose` stack (real Postgres, real
ML service, real Open-Meteo weather/geocode), re-run 2026-09-28 during a security/reliability
pass over `backend/**` (see "Security and reliability pass" below), not assumed or hand-written.
Every JSON block below is an actual captured response from that run; only JWTs are shortened
(`<jwt>`) for readability, and every id is a real UUID from that run (a later run will produce
different ones, the shapes won't change).

## How this maps to the ML contract (`docs/api-contract.md`, C1)

The backend calls the ML service (`src/services/mlService.js`) and re-shapes its snake_case
response into the camelCase `Recommendation` object below, stored in Postgres
(`prisma/schema.prisma`):

| ML contract (C1) | Backend (`Recommendation`) |
|---|---|
| `cost.estimated_cost_inr_per_acre` | `estimatedCost` |
| `cost.saving_inr_per_acre` | `estimatedSaving` |
| `risk.level` | `riskLevel` (`LOW`\|`MEDIUM`\|`HIGH`, uppercased) |
| `risk.reason` | `riskReason` |
| `risk.soil_health_impact` | `soilHealthImpact` |
| `risk.yield_impact` | `yieldImpact` |
| `explanation.nutrient_balance`, `explanation.formula` | inside the `explanation` Json column, as returned by the ML service |
| `recommendation.schedule` | `schedule` (Json column) |
| `weather.source` | `weatherSource` |
| `explanation.top_factors` | `topFactors` (`String[]`) |
| `model_version` | `modelVersion` |
| request `variety`, `sowing_date` | `Field.cropVariety`, `Field.sowingDate` (already on the schema; sourced from the field unless overridden per-request) |

The soil schema (`n`, `p`, `k`, `ph`, `organicCarbon`, `moisture`) is fixed by the problem
statement and is identical here to the ML contract's `soil` object — never renamed, never
extended.

**Verified gap, not previously documented:** the mapping table above is only partially true.
`topFactors` (top-level) is genuinely camelCase, but `explanation` itself is stored and returned
**as the ML service's own raw response** — `explanation.nutrient_balance`, `explanation.formula`,
`explanation.data_notes` and (redundantly) `explanation.top_factors` all stay **snake_case**, and
that last one duplicates the top-level `topFactors` verbatim. `schedule`'s array items are the
same story: `stage`/`fertilizer_type`/`quantity_kg_per_acre`/`apply_by`/`timing_note`, not
`fertilizerType`/`quantityKgPerAcre`/`applyBy`/`timingNote` as a prior draft of this doc claimed
without having actually checked. See the real `POST /fields/:id/recommendations` transcript
below and "Known gaps" at the end — a frontend consuming `schedule` or `explanation` fields
needs the snake_case names, not the camelCase ones the rest of this API uses everywhere else.

## Conventions

- Base URL: `/api`.
- All request and response bodies are JSON. Top-level `Farm`/`Field`/`SoilTest`/`FertilizerLog`/
  `Recommendation` fields are **camelCase**; `Recommendation.schedule` and `.explanation` are the
  ML service's own snake_case payload, passed through as-is (see the gap noted above).
- **Error shape:** `{ "error": "<message>", "details"?: <zod .flatten() output> }`. `details`
  is only present on a `422` validation failure (`src/middleware/validate.middleware.js`).
- **Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` on every route except
  `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/refresh` and `/health`.
- **Pagination:** `?page=<n>&limit=<n>` (both optional, default page 1 / a default limit,
  capped at a max limit — `src/utils/pagination.js`) on every list endpoint. Response shape:
  `{ "items": [...], "page": 1, "limit": 20, "total": 0 }`.
- **Roles:** `FARMER` (default) and `AGRONOMIST` exist on `User.role`, but **no endpoint is
  currently role-gated** — both roles have identical permissions today. `AGRONOMIST` is
  reserved for the stretch regional-summary feature (J13, not built yet). Documented here as a
  known, deliberate gap, not an oversight.
- **Ownership:** every farm/field-scoped route checks the resource belongs to the
  authenticated user; a resource that exists but belongs to someone else returns the same
  `404 { "error": "Not found" }` as a resource that doesn't exist at all (never a `403` that
  would confirm the resource's existence to someone who doesn't own it) — verified with an
  automated ownership matrix (`tests/ownership.test.js`) covering every route below in one
  place, both directions (the non-owner gets 404 everywhere; the real owner still gets through
  everywhere).
- **Request id:** every response carries a unique `X-Request-Id` header, and the same id
  appears in that request's structured log line (see below) — useful for tracing one specific
  request through logs.
- **CORS:** `CORS_ORIGIN` (env) is a real allowlist, comma-separated for more than one origin,
  not a single trusted string. A browser request with an `Origin` header not on the list gets a
  real `403`, never a silently-reflected origin.

## Status codes used across this API

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `200` / `201` | Success (`201` for a resource creation; `200` for a duplicate recommendation request within the idempotency window, see below) |
| `204` | Success, no body (`DELETE /farms/:id`, `POST /auth/logout`) |
| `400` | A referenced id isn't valid in context (unknown `cropType`/`cropVariety`/`growthStage` against `/reference/crops`, unknown `fertilizerType` in a risk check, or the ML service rejected the request payload as invalid), or a disallowed CORS origin |
| `401` | Missing/invalid/expired access token; wrong login credentials; invalid/reused/expired refresh token |
| `404` | Resource not found, **or** found but not owned by the caller |
| `409` | A prerequisite is missing (field has no `cropType`/`growthStage` set yet, or no soil test logged yet), or a real, race-condition-safe unique-constraint conflict (e.g. two concurrent registrations with the same email — Prisma's own `P2002`, mapped centrally in `error.middleware.js`, not just the common-case pre-check in `auth.controller.js`) |
| `422` | Request body failed validation (zod) |
| `429` | Rate limited (auth endpoints: 10 requests / 15 min in production; geocode: 30 / min) |
| `502` | The ML service is unreachable or returned something the backend couldn't parse |
| `503` | Live, cached and seasonal-average weather are all unavailable |

## `POST /auth/register`

```json
{ "email": "asha@example.com", "password": "a-strong-password", "name": "Asha Singh", "role": "FARMER" }
```
`role` is optional, defaults to `FARMER`. `password` must be at least 10 characters.

**201**
```json
{
  "user": { "id": "79530ac6-49c0-4def-97f0-bdb8a78cba43", "email": "asha@example.com", "name": "Asha Singh", "role": "FARMER", "createdAt": "2026-09-27T22:09:52.717Z" },
  "accessToken": "<jwt>",
  "refreshToken": "1a48bdfc7e9e884d32c6eea400b851f41f902df4432091565207e1062b462dd5c743bd0c0c8fdf710a09030e242b3586"
}
```

Registering the same email again:

**409**
```json
{ "error": "Email already registered" }
```
This is a pre-check (`findUnique` then `create`), which is why it's usually this clean message —
but two *concurrent* registrations with the same email can still race past that check; the
loser now gets a proper `409` from a real Prisma `P2002`, not an uncaught `500`
(`tests/error.middleware.test.js`'s own concurrent-registration test proves the race happens and
is handled, not just that the code compiles).

## `POST /auth/login`

```json
{ "email": "asha@example.com", "password": "a-strong-password" }
```
**200**: same shape as register's response. Wrong password:

**401**
```json
{ "error": "Invalid email or password" }
```
Same message and timing for a wrong password or an unknown email — a real `bcrypt.compare`
always runs, even against a dummy hash, so response time doesn't leak whether the account exists.

## `POST /auth/refresh`

```json
{ "refreshToken": "<opaque token>" }
```
**200**: a **new** pair —
```json
{ "accessToken": "<jwt>", "refreshToken": "9e1c4044bb62dcc03e9f477a7683b1bee3f9d796a7735e05b0ac9064ac1c81fb56dfc9f0f6348cf07f65b0e89609b8ca" }
```
refresh tokens rotate on every use; the presented token is immediately revoked. Presenting that
same (now-revoked) token again:

**401**
```json
{ "error": "Refresh token reuse detected — session revoked" }
```
Treated as theft/replay — revokes every refresh token the user has, not just the reused one.

## `POST /auth/logout`

Requires auth. Body: `{ "refreshToken": "<opaque token>" }`. **204**, no body. Revokes that one
refresh token.

## `GET /auth/me`

Requires auth. **200**
```json
{ "id": "79530ac6-49c0-4def-97f0-bdb8a78cba43", "email": "asha@example.com", "name": "Asha Singh", "role": "FARMER", "createdAt": "2026-09-27T22:09:52.717Z" }
```
No `passwordHash`, ever, in any auth response. Without a token: **401**
`{ "error": "Missing access token" }`.

## `GET /farms` · `POST /farms`

Requires auth. `POST` body: `{ "name": "Green Valley Farm" }` → **201**
```json
{ "id": "bd6d53d4-a97e-4d2b-93fe-14fcfa6e060d", "name": "Green Valley Farm", "ownerId": "243ba465-1470-4928-bb56-dbf9e20bbcaf", "createdAt": "2026-09-27T22:09:55.918Z" }
```
`GET`: paginated list of the caller's own farms —
`{ "items": [ { "...": "same Farm shape" } ], "page": 1, "limit": 20, "total": 1 }`.

## `GET /farms/:id` · `DELETE /farms/:id`

Requires auth + ownership. `GET` → the same `Farm` shape as above. `DELETE` → **204**, no body
(cascades to every field, soil test, fertilizer log and recommendation under it — see the
schema's `onDelete: Cascade`). A non-owner (or non-existent id): **404**
`{ "error": "Not found" }`.

## `GET /farms/:farmId/fields` · `POST /farms/:farmId/fields`

Requires auth + farm ownership. `POST` body (all but `name` optional):
```json
{
  "name": "Wheat Field 1", "areaAcres": 2.5, "latitude": 30.911, "longitude": 75.847,
  "pincode": "141001", "cropType": "wheat", "growthStage": "sowing",
  "irrigation": "irrigated", "sowingDate": "2026-11-01"
}
```
**201**
```json
{
  "id": "44db48dc-9b9d-4876-95fb-911c585d4127", "name": "Wheat Field 1",
  "farmId": "bd6d53d4-a97e-4d2b-93fe-14fcfa6e060d", "areaAcres": 2.5,
  "latitude": 30.911, "longitude": 75.847, "pincode": "141001",
  "cropType": "wheat", "cropVariety": null, "growthStage": "sowing",
  "irrigation": "irrigated", "sowingDate": "2026-11-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "createdAt": "2026-09-27T22:09:56.440Z"
}
```
`cropType`/`cropVariety`/`growthStage`, if given, are checked against `GET /reference/crops`
(**400** `{ "error": "Unknown cropType: not-a-real-crop" }` if unknown) -- **but if the
reference service itself is down, field creation is not blocked on it** (the check is skipped,
not failed). `GET`: paginated `Field[]`, same shape.

## `GET /fields/:id` · `PATCH /fields/:id`

Requires auth + ownership (via the field's farm). `PATCH` accepts the same optional fields as
field creation (minus `name`/`pincode`) → **200**, updated `Field`. **Verified, not previously
documented:** `GET /fields/:id` embeds the parent `farm` object too —

```json
{
  "id": "44db48dc-9b9d-4876-95fb-911c585d4127", "...": "the rest of Field",
  "farm": { "id": "bd6d53d4-a97e-4d2b-93fe-14fcfa6e060d", "name": "Green Valley Farm", "ownerId": "243ba465-1470-4928-bb56-dbf9e20bbcaf", "createdAt": "2026-09-27T22:09:55.918Z" }
}
```
`PATCH`'s response does **not** include `farm` — only `GET` does.

## `GET /geocode?q=<place name>`

Requires auth. Rate-limited (30/min). Proxies Open-Meteo geocoding.

**200**
```json
[
  { "name": "Ludhiana", "admin": "Punjab", "latitude": 30.91204, "longitude": 75.85379 },
  { "name": "Ludhiāna", "admin": "Uttar Pradesh", "latitude": 28.49596, "longitude": 77.85739 },
  { "name": "Ludhiana Airport", "admin": "Punjab", "latitude": 30.8547, "longitude": 75.9526 }
]
```
(Up to 5 results, India-scoped. Cached 24h per query.)

## `POST /fields/:id/soil-tests` · `GET /fields/:id/soil-tests`

Requires auth + field ownership. `POST` body: `{ "n", "p", "k", "ph", "organicCarbon",
"moisture", "testedOn"? }` (the same six fixed soil fields as the ML contract; `testedOn`
defaults to now) → **201**
```json
{ "id": "a57c6e08-2f71-41dc-84e1-23c9a0fcdf95", "fieldId": "44db48dc-9b9d-4876-95fb-911c585d4127", "n": 300, "p": 15, "k": 150, "ph": 7, "organicCarbon": 0.6, "moisture": 35, "testedOn": "2026-10-20T00:00:00.000Z" }
```
An out-of-range value (`ph: 15`): **422**
```json
{ "error": "Validation failed", "details": { "formErrors": [], "fieldErrors": { "ph": ["Too big: expected number to be <=14"] } } }
```
`GET`: paginated, newest-tested-first, same shape wrapped in `{ items, page, limit, total }`.

## `POST /fields/:id/fertilizer-logs` · `GET /fields/:id/fertilizer-logs`

Requires auth + field ownership. `POST` body: `{ "type": "urea", "quantityKgPerAcre": 150,
"appliedOn": "2026-09-10" }` → **201**
```json
{ "id": "48e45b8e-30b0-4c30-bc24-8168d3fa70dd", "fieldId": "44db48dc-9b9d-4876-95fb-911c585d4127", "type": "urea", "quantityKgPerAcre": 150, "appliedOn": "2026-09-10T00:00:00.000Z" }
```
`appliedOn` cannot be in the future — **422**
`{ "error": "Validation failed", "details": { "formErrors": [], "fieldErrors": { "appliedOn": ["appliedOn cannot be in the future"] } } }`
if it is. `GET`: paginated, newest-applied-first.

## `GET /fields/:id/weather`

Requires auth + field ownership. **400** if the field has no latitude/longitude set.

**200**
```json
{ "temperatureC": 22.2, "humidityPct": 87, "rainfallMmForecast": 0.7, "source": "live", "fetchedAt": "2026-09-27T22:09:58.114Z", "stale": false }
```
`source` is `"live"`, `"cached"` (network hiccup, serving a copy under 6h old) or
`"seasonal_average"` (both live and cache failed). `stale` is `true` for anything but a fresh
live read. **503** if all three fail.

## `POST /fields/:id/recommendations` · `GET /fields/:id/recommendations` · `GET /recommendations/:id`

Requires auth + field ownership (the single-recommendation route checks ownership through the
recommendation's own field).

`POST` body (all optional -- override the field's own crop/variety/stage for this one call):
```json
{ "soilTestId": "a57c6e08-2f71-41dc-84e1-23c9a0fcdf95" }
```
Uses the field's latest soil test if `soilTestId` isn't given. **409** if the field (after any
override) still has no `cropType` or `growthStage`, or if there's no soil test at all.
**Idempotent for 30 seconds**: an identical request (same resolved crop/variety/stage/soil
test/weather/previous-usage) within 30s of the last one returns the **existing** recommendation
with **200**, not a new row (verified: two immediately-repeated calls returned the identical
`id`, second one at `200`) -- a real repeated network retry doesn't create duplicate history
entries. Calls the ML service and Open-Meteo weather internally; **502** if the ML service is
unreachable or its response doesn't validate, **400** if the ML service reports the request
itself was invalid.

**201** (or **200** if idempotent-matched) -- real transcript, field with a 150 kg/acre urea log
already applied:
```json
{
  "id": "c857f47d-cc3d-411b-ae6f-df4ab554eec1",
  "fieldId": "44db48dc-9b9d-4876-95fb-911c585d4127",
  "soilTestId": "a57c6e08-2f71-41dc-84e1-23c9a0fcdf95",
  "cropType": "wheat", "cropVariety": null, "growthStage": "second_irrigation",
  "fertilizerType": "urea", "quantityKgPerAcre": 22.417,
  "schedule": [
    { "stage": "second_irrigation", "apply_by": "2026-12-21", "timing_note": null, "fertilizer_type": "urea", "quantity_kg_per_acre": 22.417 }
  ],
  "risk": {
    "level": "HIGH",
    "reason": "Applied N is 170.5 kg/ha, 335% of the 51.0 kg/ha the crop needs.",
    "soilHealthImpact": "Nitrogen applied well beyond crop need can acidify the soil over time and leach into groundwater rather than being taken up by the plant.",
    "yieldImpact": "Extra fertilizer beyond what the crop can use adds cost without adding yield -- money spent for no extra grain."
  },
  "topFactors": [
    "The standard irrigated dose for wheat is 123.6 kg/ha of N.",
    "You already applied about 170.5059 kg/ha of N-containing fertilizer recently; at this crop's nutrient-use efficiency, that credits 72.6 kg/ha against the new dose.",
    "The standard irrigated dose for wheat is 61.8 kg/ha of P2O5.",
    "Across its training data, the model's single most influential input for product choice is crop type (chickpea) -- for this field, that value is 0.0."
  ],
  "explanation": {
    "formula": "fertilizer needed = standard dose for the crop + soil-test adjustment - credit for recent applications",
    "data_notes": ["The product classifier's top guess (np_28_28_0) differed from the rule-based plan; the rule-based plan was kept."],
    "top_factors": ["...", "identical to the top-level topFactors above, verbatim -- see the gap noted at the top of this doc"],
    "nutrient_balance": {
      "n": { "method": "reference_dose", "soil_rating": "medium", "prior_credit_kg_ha": 72.636, "standard_dose_kg_ha": 123.6, "soil_adjustment_kg_ha": 0, "fertilizer_needed_kg_ha": 50.964 },
      "p": { "method": "reference_dose", "soil_rating": "medium", "prior_credit_kg_ha": 0, "standard_dose_kg_ha": 61.8, "soil_adjustment_kg_ha": 0, "fertilizer_needed_kg_ha": 61.8 },
      "k": { "method": "reference_dose", "soil_rating": "medium", "prior_credit_kg_ha": 0, "standard_dose_kg_ha": 0, "soil_adjustment_kg_ha": 0, "fertilizer_needed_kg_ha": 0 }
    }
  },
  "weatherSource": "live", "weatherStale": false,
  "estimatedCost": 132.709, "estimatedSaving": 755.291, "savingTotal": 1888.2275,
  "modelVersion": "fertilizer-classifier-0.1.1+rules-4b2ba173",
  "createdAt": "2026-09-27T22:09:58.911Z"
}
```
`savingTotal` is `estimatedSaving * field.areaAcres` (null if either is null) -- the ML
contract's saving is per acre, this is the whole field (2.5 acres here: `755.291 * 2.5 =
1888.2275`, exactly).

`GET /fields/:id/recommendations`: paginated, **newest-first** (`orderBy createdAt desc`).
`GET /recommendations/:id`: a single recommendation by id (still ownership-checked, inline in
the controller rather than via the shared `assertFieldOwner`/`assertFarmOwner` middleware --
same 404 behavior either way, verified in the ownership matrix).

## `POST /fields/:id/risk-check`

Requires auth + field ownership. Same prerequisite checks as creating a recommendation (409 if
no crop type/growth stage/soil test). Body:
```json
{ "plannedApplication": [{ "fertilizerType": "urea", "quantityKgPerAcre": 200 }] }
```
`plannedApplication` needs at least one item; each `fertilizerType` is checked against
`GET /reference/fertilizers` (**400** `{ "error": "Unknown fertilizerType: not-a-real-fertilizer" }`
if unknown, before calling the ML service at all).

**200** -- real transcript (same field, a bigger planned dose than the recommendation above):
```json
{
  "risk": {
    "level": "high",
    "reason": "Applied N is 227.3 kg/ha, 446% of the 51.0 kg/ha the crop needs.",
    "soilHealthImpact": "Nitrogen applied well beyond crop need can acidify the soil over time and leach into groundwater rather than being taken up by the plant.",
    "yieldImpact": "Extra fertilizer beyond what the crop can use adds cost without adding yield -- money spent for no extra grain.",
    "overApplicationPct": 346.1
  },
  "nutrientBalance": {
    "n": { "appliedKgHa": 227.34, "recommendedKgHa": 50.964, "ratio": 4.461 },
    "p": { "appliedKgHa": 0, "recommendedKgHa": 61.8, "ratio": 0 },
    "k": { "appliedKgHa": 0, "recommendedKgHa": 0, "ratio": 1 }
  }
}
```
This is a pure check -- nothing is written to the database. Note `nutrientBalance` here IS
camelCase (unlike a recommendation's `explanation.nutrient_balance`) -- this route builds its
own response shape rather than passing through the ML service's raw payload.

## `GET /fields/:id/trends`

Requires auth + field ownership. Last 24 months, three independent time series a chart can
draw directly. Real transcript, same field (one soil test, one 150 kg/acre urea log, one
recommendation so far):

```json
{
  "soilTests": [{ "testedOn": "2026-10-20T00:00:00.000Z", "n": 300, "p": 15, "k": 150, "ph": 7, "organicCarbon": 0.6, "moisture": 35 }],
  "applied": [{ "month": "2026-09", "nitrogenKgAcre": 69, "p2o5KgAcre": 0, "k2oKgAcre": 0, "costInr": 888 }],
  "recommendations": [{ "createdAt": "2026-09-27T22:09:58.911Z", "fertilizerType": "urea", "quantityKgPerAcre": 22.417, "estimatedCost": 132.709, "riskLevel": "HIGH", "fertilizerNeededN": 50.964, "fertilizerNeededP": 61.8, "fertilizerNeededK": 0 }]
}
```
`applied` aggregates logged `fertilizerLogs` into calendar months using each product's N/P2O5/K2O
percentages and price from `/reference/fertilizers` (a log for a product no longer in that
list is silently excluded from `applied`, not errored). Empty arrays, not an error, for a field
with no history yet (verified: `tests/trends.test.js`'s own "brand-new field" test).

## `GET /reference/crops` · `/reference/soil-ratings` · `/reference/fertilizers`

Requires auth. Proxied from the ML service (`ml/src/api/endpoints/reference.py`), cached with a
stale-while-revalidate fallback (fresh under 1h, stale-but-served under 24h, `503` past that
if the ML service is also down). Shapes are exactly the ML contract's
(`docs/api-contract.md`'s `GET /reference/*` section) -- this backend doesn't rename these
fields to camelCase since the ML service's own `id`/`name_en`/`n_pct` etc. are already the
public shape both frontend and backend consume as-is. Real transcript, `/reference/soil-ratings`
(short enough to show in full; `crops`/`fertilizers` are longer lists of the same shape):
```json
[
  { "parameter": "organic_carbon", "unit": "%", "very_low_below": null, "low_below": 0.5, "high_above": 0.75 },
  { "parameter": "n", "unit": "kg/ha", "very_low_below": null, "low_below": 280, "high_above": 560 },
  { "parameter": "p", "unit": "kg/ha", "very_low_below": null, "low_below": 10, "high_above": 25 },
  { "parameter": "k", "unit": "kg/ha", "very_low_below": null, "low_below": 108, "high_above": 280 },
  { "parameter": "ph", "unit": "pH units", "very_low_below": null, "low_below": 6.5, "high_above": 7.5 }
]
```

## Security and reliability pass (2026-09-28)

Every item below was checked directly (reading the code, running the real suite, or hitting a
real running server), not assumed. `backend/PROGRESS.md`-equivalent detail lives in the
individual commits; this is the summary a reader of this contract needs.

- **Auth coverage:** every route is behind `requireAuth` except `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`,
  `/auth/refresh` and `/health` -- verified by reading every route file, not just this list.
- **Ownership matrix** (`tests/ownership.test.js`, new): one comprehensive test, not scattered
  assertions, covering farm/field/soil test/fertilizer log/recommendation (both nested and
  direct)/weather/risk-check/trends -- a non-owner gets 404 everywhere, a real owner still
  succeeds everywhere (two separate tests, so a routing bug that 404s for *everyone* would also
  be caught).
- **No hardcoded secrets** -- grepped the whole tree; every credential comes from `env`.
- **`helmet()`** with its defaults, a real **CORS allowlist** (comma-separated `CORS_ORIGIN`,
  a disallowed origin gets a real `403`, not a silent reflect-or-500), a **100kb body limit**,
  a **request id** (`X-Request-Id`, also in the structured log line) and **structured JSON
  logs** (`request_id`, `method`, `path`, `status`, `latency_ms`, `user_id` -- deliberately
  narrow, never the request body, a password, or the `Authorization` header; replaces the
  previous plain-text `morgan` access log).
- **Error middleware** maps a `ZodError` to `400` (defense-in-depth -- nothing currently throws
  one directly; every route's own `validate()` middleware already returns its own `422` with a
  `details` payload first, a deliberate, separately-tested design, not changed here), a Prisma
  `P2002` (unique constraint) to `409`, a Prisma `P2025` (record not found) to `404`, anything
  else to a generic `500`. The `P2002` path is live today, not theoretical: `auth.controller.js`'s
  register pre-checks for a duplicate email, but a genuinely concurrent double-registration can
  still race past that check -- `tests/error.middleware.test.js` reproduces the real race and
  confirms the loser gets a proper `409`, not an uncaught `500`.
- **Graceful shutdown:** `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` now stop the server from accepting new connections,
  let in-flight ones finish, disconnect Prisma's pool, then exit -- verified by sending a real
  `SIGTERM` to a running process and confirming a clean exit within 1 second. Previously the
  process was killed outright with no cleanup.
- **`npm audit --omit=dev` reviewed:** 3 high-severity findings, all confined to `prisma`'s own
  devDependency chain (`@prisma/config` → `deepmerge-ts@7.1.5`, a stack-exhaustion advisory
  fixed in `deepmerge-ts@8.0.0+`) -- never installed in the production image (`Dockerfile` runs
  `npm ci --omit=dev`). `npm audit fix --force` would *downgrade* prisma to `6.12.0`, not
  upgrade it; not applied, since that trades a low-practical-risk dev-tooling advisory for an
  actual regression in the pinned toolchain version. Worth revisiting when prisma ships a patch
  that bumps its own `deepmerge-ts` pin.
- **`.env.example`** matches `src/config/env.js`'s schema exactly, field for field -- checked
  directly, not assumed.
- **A real bug found and fixed while building the structured logger:** reading `req.path` lazily
  inside `res.on('finish')` isn't guaranteed to see Express's fully-restored URL after a nested
  router's prefix-stripping/restoring -- two near-simultaneous requests to the identical route
  logged two different paths before the fix (`/register` and `/api/auth/register`). Fixed by
  snapshotting `method`/`path` at request start instead; regression test in
  `tests/logging.middleware.test.js`.

## Known gaps (flagged, not hidden)

- **`explanation`/`schedule` stay snake_case** inside an otherwise-camelCase API -- see the note
  at the top of this document. Not fixed here (a contract-shape change, not a
  security/reliability issue) -- flagged clearly so a frontend integration doesn't get surprised
  by `explanation.nutrient_balance` instead of `explanation.nutrientBalance`.
- **`topFactors` is fully duplicated** as `explanation.top_factors` -- redundant, not wrong.
- **CI now runs the real test suite against a real Postgres service container**
  (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s `backend` job), not just lint -- this used to be an open gap
  ("the CI workflow currently only runs `npm run lint`"), closed by J10; updated here since a
  prior draft of this doc hadn't caught up to that.
- **`AGRONOMIST` role has no differentiated permissions yet** (see "Roles" above).
